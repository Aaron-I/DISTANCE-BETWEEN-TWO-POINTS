# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1: 
Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation

### Step 2: 
Mention the coordinates as given

### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)

### Step 4:
Assign the values of coordinates in the formula

### Step 5:
End the program

### PROGRAM:
#Program to find the distance between two points.

```
x1,x2,y1,y2=10,4,6,2
d=(((x2-x1)**2)+((y2-y1)**2))**0.5
print(round(d,2))  
```

### OUTPUT:
